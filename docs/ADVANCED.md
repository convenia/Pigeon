## Introducing
 Let's see some advanced uses of Pigeon
 
## Headers
 You can easily add `application_headers` to message when publishing one with `header` method
 
 ```php
use Pigeon;

Pigeon::routing($routing)
    ->header($key, $value);    
```  

?> You can also pass **associative array** as value for header, it will be converted to dot notation

You can also capture all message headers with the resolver in your callback with `headers` method
 ```php
 use Pigeon;
 
$callback = function ($data, $resolver) {
    $resolver->headers();
};
 Pigeon::queue($queue)
    ->callback($callback);    
 ```  
 
?> If you want a specific header you can pass it key to headers and it'll return only the header you asked for

!> In the opposite of publishing message, when consuming headers will not return only the **application_headers**
but all AMQPMessage internal headers
